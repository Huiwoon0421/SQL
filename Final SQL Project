# For this project, I downloaded a data called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
# I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#1.
Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. 
Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country='Brazil';

#3.
Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT Cust.FirstName, Cust.LastName, Inv.invoiceId, Inv.invoiceDate, Inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices Inv
INNER JOIN chinook.customers Cust
ON Inv.CustomerId = Cust.CustomerID
WHERE Inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4.
Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent" ;

#5.
Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;

#6.
Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

WITH INV_CTE AS 
(SELECT INV.invoiceid, Cust.SupportRepid
FROM invoices INV
LEFT JOIN Customers Cust
ON INV.CustomerID= Cust.CustomerID)

SELECT INV_CTE.invoiceid, EMP.EmployeeId, EMP.LastName, EMP.FirstName
FROM INV_CTE
INNER JOIN employees EMP
ON INV_CTE.SupportRepid=EMP.EmployeeId
WHERE Title='Sales Support Agent';

#7.
Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT Cust.FirstName, Cust.LastName, Cust.Country, Emp.FirstName, Emp.LastName, INV.total
FROM Chinook.invoices INV
JOIN Chinook.customers Cust
ON INV.CustomerId = Cust.CustomerId
JOIN Chinook.employees Emp
ON Cust.SupportRepid=Emp.EmployeeID;

#8/
How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceID)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#9.
What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10.
Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT TRA.Name, InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks TRA
INNER JOIN chinook.invoice_items INV
ON TRA.TrackId = INV.TrackId;

#11.
Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT TRA.Name, Art.Name, INV.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks TRA
INNER JOIN chinook.invoice_items INV
ON TRA.TrackId = INV.TrackId
LEFT JOIN chinook.albums Alb
ON TRA.AlbumId = Alb.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists Art
ON Alb.ArtistId = Art.ArtistId;

#12.
Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT T.Name AS 'TrackName', A.Title AS 'AlbumName', M.Name AS 'MediaTypeName', G.Name AS'GenresName'
FROM chinook.tracks T
JOIN chinook.albums A
ON A.AlbumId = T.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types M
ON M.MediaTypeId = T.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres G
ON G.GenreId = T.GenreId;

#13.
Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT EMP.LastName, EMP.FirstName, ROUND(SUM(INV.Total),2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.invoices INV
JOIN chinook.customers Cust
ON INV.CustomerId = Cust.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees EMP
ON Cust.SupportRepid = EMP.EmployeeId
GROUP BY EMP.LastName, EMP.FirstName;

#14.
Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT EMP.LastName, EMP.FirstName, ROUND(SUM(INV.Total),2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.invoices INV
JOIN chinook.customers Cust
ON INV.CustomerId = Cust.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees EMP
ON Cust.SupportRepid = EMP.EmployeeId
WHERE INV.invoiceDate LIKE '%2009%'
GROUP BY EMP.LastName, EMP.FirstName
ORDER BY TotalSales desc LIMIT 1;
